# Algo Traders Club: Aster Operator Project

## What We're Building 🔥

We're building the #1 educational community teaching developers to create algorithmic trading bots for perpetual DEXs, starting with **Aster Operator** - a delta-neutral trading bot for Aster DEX.

The Operator (inspired by The Matrix) is designed as an open-source, educational codebase that demonstrates how to connect to perps DEX APIs, manage leveraged positions, implement risk controls, and farm airdrop points safely.

This is the first in a series of "Operators" - each targeting a different DEX (Hyperliquid, Paradex, Pacifica, etc.) - that will serve as both learning resources for our community and templates that members can fork and customize for their own strategies.

The end goal is to empower developers (especially those struggling in the current job market) to build supplemental income through algorithmic trading while learning valuable skills in API integration, risk management, and quantitative strategy development.

All code is MIT licensed, heavily commented for education, and designed to be modified by AI assistants ("vibe coding") so beginners can start with working examples and iterate quickly.
